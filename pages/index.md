# About me

I love learning programming languages and and building well designed software. There is something almost magical when you see a well written program or a new feature in a computer language that just "fits". I'll never forget the first time I looked at a LISP macro or a finally understood (as much as you can understand)" a monad; spine chilling and exhilarating. The first time you build your solution with containers and suddenly realize years of fighting with configuration differences are gone in the blink of an eye: cathartic.

I've developed production software for nearly 8 years - from business case analysis, to design and team lead, to developer, to solution architect and a bit of Dev Ops sprinkled in. In that time, I've tried to take the good ideas I've seen and introduce them into production software to improve quality and general reliability.

My background is a bit different from your typical developer. I am a qualified actuary. I was a statistics/computer science undergrad and I ended up sitting for the actuarial exams and getting hired by a consulting firm - but over the nearly two years there, I spent the majority of the time building and maintaing risk adjustment software written in SAS and Java.

From there, I went to work in a more traditional insurer as an actuary for about 3 years before being hired back to a consulting firm, but again to build actuarial and analytical software. Over the past 6 years I've been a developer, solutions architect, product owner of various software products (internal pricing software and consumer facing decision support products) and served as a team lead for our innovation hub in Singapore (50 actuaries, developers and data scientists). I recently moved back to Denver to take on a role developing rapid protoype products and modernizing our team's Dev Ops stack and coding standards.

In terms of technologies used in production, the majority of my work has been with C#/.Net stack and Angular/React, but I've managed to slip in some Clojure for backend processing (yes you can do that when you're the boss) and used Pharo Smalltalk to prototype a few APIs before converting them to C# in production. I've also used R professionally (and python a bit) for our data intensive projects and am a huge fan of Docker, Elixir (still learning) and Rust (still haven't found a use case at work for it yet). 

I have an on again/off again relationship with Haskell and Common Lisp. Having cut my teeth on a risk adjuster and pricing software where the penalty of errors was high, I naturally love testing, specifically property based testing and I've spent enough time hunting down hidden mutation to appreciate the functional paradigmn (though I'm slightly obsessed with reconciling true OOP - like Smalltalk - and functional programming).

While software development is a passion, I can't completely abandon my actuarial roots. I also like to think through how best practices from the development and data science world can be "ported" over to actuarial land and be applied to improve how actuaries work.
